Genietend van de laatste zonnestralen sjouwen we onze spullen naar de boot. Na de uitgebreide instructie en het stouwen gaan rap de lijntjes los. Met het plan een rondje om Goeree en Schouwen te varen, gaat het richting de Haringvlietbrug. Die zou om 20:00 nog draaien, maar de dubbelrode lampjes doen anders vermoeden. De marifoon geeft uitsluitsel: in verband met problemen draait hij pas morgenochtend 10:00. We hebben geen zin om daar op te wachten of weer terug te moeten naar Willemstad, dus op naar de sluis om te Schutten naar het Volkerak. Plan B is een overnachting in Oude Tonge, wat volgens de almanak net kan met onze 2 meter diepgang. \n\n Na een mooi stukje nachtvaren dobberen we rustig achter de fok aan het geultje naar Oude Tonge binnen. Johannes staat voorop naar de onverlichte bebakening turen en Toos geeft bij de plotter de roerganger aanwijzingen 'beetje stuurboord', 'een eindje bakboord'. Na een stukje varen lijkt het toch wel erg langzaam te gaan, een blik op de dieptemeter leert dat we in 1.5m diep water varen.\n\nNa gefaalde een poging achteruit te steken mocht Jieter hoog en droog op de giek plaatsnemen waarna we zijn 0.1&nbsp;ton een gieklengte buitenboord konden inzetten. Na wat aandringen wil 'Planeer' toch weer van zijn plaats komen. Als Oude Tonge ons niet wil moeten we maar gaan voor plan C: een overnachting aan de staatssteigers van de Krammersluis.",

Na de keersluis gaat het grootzeil omhoog, wat al vrij snel redelijk optimistisch blijkt te zijn. Net nadat we het geultje uit zijn gaat er een rif in en we kruisen wat halve wind heen en weer tot de Zeelandbrug een gaatje voor ons maakt, met een boot of tien persen we ons erdoor. Na de brug eten we Zeeuwse bolussen van Arie en is het een stukje kruisen, waarna het na de bocht beter bezeild wordt. Nu het niet meer zo aan de wind is kan al het zeil erbij en het schiet lekker op. \n\n![Zeelandbrug op de achtergrond](P1060978.thumb.JPG) Toos verbaast zich over de eetlust van de mannen, Jieter associeert er vrolijk op los en Martijn verzorgt die eetlust met broodjes knakworst.

Rond 12 uur arriveerden Martijn en Margriet en toen Abraham en Haap terug kwamen konden we de boodschappen in alle hoeken en gaten proppen. Om een uurtje of twee vertrok Margriet weer; die zal zich en Edinburgh weer bij ons voegen. Trossen werden losgegooid om 14:17 en na een korte modderploegsessie vlak buiten Lemmer sloegen we ‘high aspect’-fok aan en hesen het zeil. Een flinke noordwester 5 Beaufort zorgde voor nare golven op het IJsselmeer. Jieter en daarna Haap waren de eersten die een streepje op het Kotsklassement konden bijschrijven. Rond 6 uur slobberden we wat bonenschotel in ons gezicht en liepen aan bij de Stevinsluizen in Den Oever. De sluiswachter werd wat chagrijnig omdat hij Jieter niet zo goed kon verstaan over de marifoon (Abraham kon hem erg goed imiteren: ‘Wat zèg je nou?’), maar we werden uiteindelijk toch geschut nadat hij ‘een gaatje voor ons had gevonden’. We motorden door de vaargeul richting Den Helder terwijl het langzaam donker werd en navigeren dus steeds interessanter: ‘Welke groene ISO 4s moet ik nou hebben?’. Er dook van stuurboord achter ook opeens een onverlichte RIB op waarvan de opvarenden vroegen waar we heen gingen en toen weer net zo snel weg waren als ze gekomen waren. Om middernacht liepen we aan in de haven van de Koninklijke Marine Jacht Club. Na een pilsje zijn we lekker gaan tukken.",

			"text": "Vandaag om een uurtje of 10 opgestaan en rond half 12 kwamen Jantine en Hotske aan met aanhang. Daarvoor konden we nog even genieten van een demo van marineschepen en –helikopters tijdens de Marinehavendagen. We zijn nu lekker pannenkoeken aan het eten en kiezen zo het ruime sop van de Noordzee richting Engeland.\n\n**N54°59.57 E00°51.37 maandag 4 juli 19:37 UTC+2**\n\nOm 15:00 uur vertrokken uit Den Helder met weer een mooie NW5 en dubbel rif. De golven op de Noordzee waren toch van een ander formaat dan op het IJsselmeer en daar moest iedereen duidelijk aan wennen, dus een boel ‘zieken’ op de banken en in de kooien. ![Het is net...](IMG_1496.thumb.JPG) Ik moest zelf ook behoorlijk wennen; buiten ging het wel, maar langer dan een paar minuten in de kajuit was niet uit te houden. De wind nam iets af en we hebben een rif uit het zeil gehaald. Ondertussen voelde ik me ook niet zo goed en heb mijn kop goulashsoep gelijk weer in zee gebrokt. Het was inmiddels acht uur en aangezien mijn wacht van 0:00 tot 4:00 uur zou duren besloot ik mijn kooi in de duiken. Ik heb nog meegekregen dat het tweede rif uit het zil ging en de genua 1 werd gehesen. ![Jieter achter de navigatietafel](IMG_1501.thumb.JPG) Jieter kwam op een gegeven moment binnen om te zeggen dat ik nu van 4:00 tot 8:00 uur wacht had en dus nog lekker door kon slapen. Dat heb ik gedaan tot ik door Haap wakker werd gemaakt om samen met Hotske aan mijn wacht te beginnen. Dat begon goed door bijna tegen een kardinale zuidton te varen die bij een olieplatform hoorde. Hotske werd niet lekker en liet ons bijna de puts verliezen door hem achter de boot aan te laten slepen. Deze hebben we met veel krachtsinspanning uit het water gekregen. Ondertussen nog een mooie zonsopgang gezien en in een poging de navigatielichten uit te doen ook de instrumenten uitgezet en het log gereset (sorry Jieter…). Al met al een enerverende nacht.\n\nDe wind kakte ondertussen steeds verder in en we hebben besloten het zeil maar de strijken en op de motor verder te varen. Hat was wel heerlijk warm, zonnig weer, maar met een wind van 3 knopen begin je niet zoveel. We hebben gedurende de dag het motorbootje nog opgepompt en Jieter er even in achter de boot aan getrokken tot ik per ongeluk de lijn losgooide en we om moesten keren… Ondertussen trekt de wind wat aan vanuit het zuiden, dus zo misschien het ![zeil maar weer omhoog](http://youtu.be/r0RJn8LkRyw). De planning is dat we morgen rond 11:00 uur in Newcastle zullen zijn. De Noordzee is trouwens echt een grote boorput zeg, je ziet constant wel ergens een boorplatform om je heen. Het begint echt te waaien, joepie! \n\nDe plannen waren ondertussen gewijzigd en we zouden naar Sunderland, net onder Newcastle. Ik zou maandagavond van 20:00 tot 0:00 uur wacht staan met Haap en we hebben gezellig thee gedronken terwijl Henk (onze stuurautomaat) aan het roer zat. Henk heeft trouwens bijna de hele tijd dat we hebben gemotord aan het roer gezeten. Na ons theekransje zagen we een flikkerlicht en na een blik op de kaart bleek dit de Engelse kust te zijn! Het was de vuurtoren van Flamborough Head. Hierna gingen Haap en ik slapen en heeft de volgende wacht een dolfijn gezien die met de boot meezwom! \n\n![Er zat vast iets vast ofzo](IMG_1548.thumb.JPG)De volgende ochtend wakker geworden en lekker in het zonnetje verder gezeild. Rond 14:00 uur Haap de mast in gehesen om onze vlaggencollectie op te hangen, dat is ‘toch best een beetje spannend’ met zulke golven. Ondertussen lopen we aan in de haven van Sunderland, maar de communicatie via de marifoon ging niet heel soepel. Dit is later door Jieter gefixt, iets met een los contactje. De box in varen ging ook niet vlekkeloos en de man aan de kant sprak ook al geen fatsoenlijk Engels, maar om 15:07 UTC+2 lagen we in de haven. De klok ging opeens een uur achteruit en we hadden weer vaste grond onder de voeten. We gingen gelijk op zoek naar wat te eten, maar dat is blijkbaar lastig ’s middags. Uiteindelijk in een hotel aan de kust uitgekomen waar we eten aan de bar moesten bestellen en begonnen ze ook nog te zeuren dat de chefs er nog niet waren. Wij wilden gewoon eten! Na een uur te hebben gezeten eindelijk een bord vlees naar binnen gewerkt met een halve liter bier: Koekkoek! Hierna terug gekuierd naar de boot en toen gingen mensen douchen en ik ging met Martijn het rubberbootje uitproberen. De buitenboordmotor liep niet zo lekker, maar dat heeft Martijn verholpen met een schroevendraaier. Hierna nog een spelletje gedaan, pils gedronken, gedoucht en gaan slapen.",

We hadden wat moeite met het vinden van een plekje, want dieper de haven in was het ondiep volgens de kaart en de voorhaven lag vol. Uiteindelijk een plekje gevonden naast een Duitser die blij was dat hij tegen iemand Duits kon spreken. Hij lag al twee dagen daar en was nog niet van de boot geweest. Hij lag op zijn beurt tegen een klipper aan die vrij ver van de kant lag. Ik ben met Martijn met het rubberbootje naar de kant gevaren op zoek naar ‘fish and chips’. We kwamen nog een oude man tegen die een verhaal afstak over vrijmetselarij en toen hebben we de rest gehaald. We hebben in een hotelletje met een paar man Haggis (een traditioneel Schots gerecht) besteld en we keken wat raar op toen de ober vroeg of we er whisky bij wilden. Hij gooide een half glaasje whisky over de Haggis en dat deed de smaak zeker goed. Na het eten wilden we gaan douchen maar we hadden geen muntjes van 50 pence. Martijn en Jieter gingen muntjes halen bij de Duitser die al aardig ‘Koekkoek!’ was en toen ze geld terug wilden geven mocht dat niet en moesten gelijk twee schnaps  meedrinken. ‘De fles moest leeg!’ Nadat de muntjes bemachtigd waren hebben we een douchebeurt van 8 minuten met z’n drieën benut met de timing van Abrahams horloge. Hierna nog even wat gedronken en gaan slapen.",

We waren tot nu toe met het bootje naar de wal gegaan omdat de sprong tussen de klipper en de kant wat groot was, maar Jantine en Hotske waagden de sprong om naar het toilet te gaan. Om 11:22 uur afgevaren richting Granton, een haventje boven Edinburgh. We hebben gisteren de wijnfles leeggedronken en laten drogen zodat Hotske er nu flessenpost mee kon maken. Ze had een mooie brief geschreven met haar adres en e-mailadres erop en er nog vieze dropjes, rijst en meer van dat soort dingen erbij gegooid en overboord geslingerd op een paar mijl van Bass Rock. Ondertussen deden ik en Jieter nog een wedstrijd wie het meeste vieze dropjes in zijn mond kon stoppen; ik had er 20 en Jieter 22. ![Bass Rock vanuit de boot. Hier broeden heel veel Jan van Genten en andere vogels](IMG_1714_edit.thumb.JPG) ![Equilibre vanaf Bass Rock](IMG_1725_edit_colors.thumb.JPG) We kwamen rond 16:00 uur langs Bass Rock; een soort grote puist in het water met enorm veel vogels erop. Er schenen nauwelijks mensen te komen dus dat wilden we wel even proberen. We gingen met de Equilibre in de luwte van de rots liggen (waar het heerlijk naar vogelpoep rook) en maakten Wall-E klaar, zoals onze rubberboot intussen heette. Ik ben met Martijn en Abraham in Wall-E gestapt en naar het trappetje op Bass Rock gevaren. Het was supermooi met al die ![vogels](http://youtu.be/IO4sMVHtpa4) om je heen, maar het was jammer dat het hek dicht zat zodat we niet helemaal naar boven konden. Na wat rondlopen en foto’s schieten (we waren ondertussen wel wat gewend aan de penetrante geur) besloten we weer terug te gaan. Ik liet nog een snijplank op mijn voet vallen en we aten macaroni op de boot. We zijn op de fok verder naar Granton gecruiset op de windkracht 3 uit het ZO die al de hele dag opstond. We liepen aan in Granton en zagen daar onze grote vriend de Duitser en gingen ernaast liggen. Er leek verder geen leven inde haven, want we konden niet betalen, douchen of naar de WC en hadden geen walstroom. We hebben nog wat geklaverjast en foto’s bekeken en zijn gaan slapen.",

We vonden er een die om half 11 begon en we hadden daardoor nog een uur om de was op te halen. Die hadden we bij een wasserette gedropt en het kostte een flinke wandeling om het weer op te halen. Uiteindelijk terug bij de kerk bleek de dienst bij een kerk verderop te zijn. We waren gelukkig precies op tijd, maar Jieter ging de was naar de boot brengen. Het was een mooie dienst in het Schots over de ‘the parable of the sower’ en mooie Engelse hymns. ![De prachtiged Forth Railway bridge.](IMG_1850_edit_colors.thumb.JPG) Hierna geluncht en met pannenkoeken en weggevaren richting de brug over de Firth of Forth. Dat is een machtig mooi, groot apparaat van vakwerken van zo’n 150 jaar oud. Hierna doorgevaren richting Inchcolm Island met windkracht 2 uit het westen. Onder Inchcolm voor anker gegaan en met Wall-E aan de kant gegaan. Het kostte 5 pond per persoon om er rond te lopen, maar als we niet naar het toilet en de Abbey gingen mocht het wel gratis. Het eiland is voornamelijk in de Eerste en Tweede Wereldoorlog gebruikt voor de Britse verdediging. De hele Firth of Forth schijnt ook vol te liggen met wapentuig. Na dit uitstapje onderweg naar Noorwegen, dus de komende drie dagen op zee...\n\n![Er is echt niets hoor...](IMG_1867_straight_colors.thumb.JPG) Na een paar uur onderweg door de Firth of Forth richting de Noordzee bleek dat de wind wel heel ongunstig was om naar Noorwegen te gaan; ongeveer 1 á 2 Bft uit het NO op dat moment. We besloten verder noordelijk in Schotland te gaan, naar Peterhead. Ik had van 0:00 uur tot 4:00 uur wacht met Jantine en daarvoor heb ik nog even in m’n boek van Ellen MacArthur gelezen. Tijdens onze wacht begon het te waaien dus hebben we het grootzeil en genua 1 bijgezet voor een NO 3-4 Bft. Rond 2:00 uur begon het te regen en daar werd het wel zwaar van. Om 4:00 uur een soepje gemaakt en lekker gaan slapen tot 11:30 uur en om 12:00 uur mijn volgende wacht met Jantine.\n\n![Langs een grote jongen die voor anker ligt te wachten op handel...](IMG_1889_straight.thumb.JPG) Het was ondertussen droog en we kwamen in de buurt van Aberdeen. Na de wacht merkte ik dat ik wel erg moe was van vannacht. Onder helling rolde ik namelijk door de kooi tegen Haap aan waardoor slapen wat lastig werd. Ik ging weer in mijn kooi liggen en heb tot 21:0 uur geslapen waarna ik wakker werd van Jieter die over de marifoon de bootnaam probeerde te spellen; ‘Echo, eh, Charlie, nee… Echo, Quebec, eh…’ Om half 10 lagen we in de haven en onze vriend de Duitser was er ook weer. Nog even met hem gepraat en hij vond het maar koud hier. Daarna even lekker gedoucht (ook al werd die halverwege koud) en nog wat eten gekookt; aardappelpuree, rode bieten en gehaktballen. Ik ben nog met Jantine een boek aan het lezen, maar de rest ligt lekker te slapen. Ik ga zo ook maar.",

Het was toch wel koud met allen een trainingsbroek en trui aan, dus maar weer in de slaapzak gekropen. \n\nNiet kunnen slapen tot mijn wacht van 4:00 tot 8:00 uur met Martijn. De wind was inmiddels aangetrokken tot 4, vlagen 5 Bft en we besloten de genua in te rollen en alleen op grootzeil verder te varen. Ik heb ook nog even een thermoskan in de kajuit aan stukjes laten vallen en zo goed en zo kwaad als kon opgeruimd. Wel allemaal glas in mijn handen nu… De golven waren intussen al rond de drie meter, ook een reden dat bij iedereen het slapen niet zo wil lukken. Na m’n wacht weer in bed gaan liggen, maar nog steeds niet kunnen slapen. Om half twee weer uit bed gegaan en maar eens wat eten in mijn hoofd gestopt. Daardoor voelde ik me wel beter dan eerst. Later weer eten gaan koken; in de herkansing van de dag ervoor. Dat was een hele bevalling want ik werd misselijk en moest regelmatig mijn kop uit het luik steken, maar aan het eind was er toch een pot nasi met ham, doperwtjes en worteltjes. Ik was zo misselijk dat ik maar een paar hapjes naar binnen kreeg en daarna ben ik weer in de slaapzak gekropen.\n\nNu wel lekker geslapen en om 4:00 uur weer wakker gemaakt voor de wacht met Martijn. Het regende, dus we hebben Henk de hele tijd laten sturen en zijn diep in ons zeilpak gekropen. Nog wel wat dolfijnen gezien; er sprong er eentje uit de golven, heel vet! Daarna weer geslapen en ’s middags nog wat nasi naar binnen gewerkt die was overgebleven en wat muesli. Eten doet een mens echt goed op zo’n tocht, ook als je er geen zin in hebt. Rond 4 uur konden we Denemarken zien en dat deed de sfeer ook goed. De wind kakte er wel uit, dus we hebben het zeil gestreken en zijn op de motor de haven in gevaren. De golfslag was nog wel flink, dat was wel vervelend. Rond een uur of zes liepen we aan in Thyborøn en zijn we op zoek gegaan naar eten. We kregen in een tentje enorme hamburgers met friet en een 0,75L-glas pils wat naar pis stonk. Thyborøn is trouwens een suf vissersstadje waar verder niks te doen is behalve over het strand lopen. De haven lag vlak naast de branding en er was een mooie zonsondergang. Na het eten is er gedoucht en schoongemaakt, want dat moet wel na zo’n reis, overal eten op de vloer en het toilet was ook niet echt schoon meer. Ook de walstroom proberen aan te sluiten, maar toen de zekering doorsloeg kwam onze buurman driftig van zijn boot af om onze stekker eruit te rukken. Na wat geprutst te hebben en de haspel schoon en droog gemaakt lukte het wel. Nog een whisky gedronken en gaan slapen. Volgende dag naar Esbjerg.",

			"text": "Vanochtend zijn er eerst wat boodschappen gedaan zodat we onder andere weer vers brood konden eten. Om half 12 uitgevaren in volle zon en windkracht 3-4 uit het zuiden. Ik heb samen met Martijn de genua 1 vervangen door de high aspect fok, iets wat 2 dagen geleden ook handig was geweest. Na een tijdje zelf een rif gestoken omdat de wind toch aardig aantrok. Hierna zwakte de wind weer af naar 3 Bft en is het rif er weer uit gehaald. Jieter heeft net wat broccolistamppot gemaakt met braadworst. \n\n![Leo met zijn ontzettende hoofd door de scheur in het zeil](IMG_2170_scheurzeil.thumb.JPG) Het schrijven van het log werd onderbroken door een knal en de uitroep: ‘Het zeil is gescheurd!’. Jieter en ik gingen snel naar buiten om het zeil te laten zakken. De geleider van de schoothoek van grootzeil bleek uit de giek te zijn geknald en het stukje zeil onder het onderlijk was gescheurd (Het zeil was uit zijn broek gescheurd). Vlak hiervoor hadden we besloten niet door te varen naa Esbjerg, een tocht van zo’n 100 mijl, maar slechts door te gaan tot Hvide Sande op ongeveer de helft. Na het scheuren van het grootzeil liepen we slechts 2 knopen over de grond op de motor dus we hebben een rif gestoken want zo werkte het zeil wel. Jieter heeft in Hvide Sande het zeil enigszins gefixt met een zeilbandje tussen schoothoek en giek. De wind was aangetrokken tot 4, vlagen 5 Bft uit het zuiden en we zijn met enkel rif naar Hvide Sande gekruist terwijl het inmiddels was gaan regenen. We zagen wel fluorescerende algen die we al een paar keer hadden gezien. Door de hekgolf van de Equilibre werd het rubberbootje verlicht van onder wat een heel mooi gezicht was. Het aanlopen van de haven werd bemoeilijkt door de smalle ingang en rondvarende baggerschepen, maar het ging vrij vlot. Om 1:00 uur lagen we dubbel met een dik, splinternieuw, Noors jacht en had Jieter zijn zaklamp in het water laten vallen. Een nachtelijke zwempartij liep op niets uit. Terwijl de dames al op bed lagen hebben we nog tot 3:00 uur gepilst en zijn toen ook gaan slapen.",

			"text": "Vandaag dag na het ontbijt kreeg Jieter het voor elkaar om ook zijn bril in het water te laten vallen, maar ook vissen met een magneetje werkte niet. Bij het verkennen van Hvide Sande bleek dat vooral een soort toeristische winkelstraat te zijn. Het barstte er van de Duitser, maar het was ons onduidelijk wat ze kwamen doen. Er zijn rustig inkopen gedaan en er is gedoucht zodat we om 17:00 uur onderweg konden naar Esbjerg. Wat opviel was dat Denen er over het algemeen een stuk beter uitzien en zich beter kleden dan de Britten aan de overkant. Om 17:00 uur zijn we dus vertrokken richting het zuiden en Martijn had een lekkere paste met rode meuk met salami gemaakt die een goede bodem legde. Ik had samen met Martijn wacht van 20:00 tot 0:00 uur moet een wind die schommelde tussen 4 en 5 Bft met uitschieters naar 6 Bft. Er was een prachtige zonsondergang. We zijn vlak langs een onweersbui gevaren waar de maan achter vandaan kwam en genoten van de ![kermislichten](http://youtu.be/lpMkCzFjBbw) van twee windmolenparken. Om 0:00 uur Haap en Jieter uit bed gehaald en gaan slapen om af en toe wakker gemaakt te worden voor een overstag. \n\nNa aankomst in Esbjerg rond 11:30 uur opgestaan en gedoucht. Daarna naar het centrum van Esbjerg(sla) gelopen op zoek naar eten. Eerst langsgegaan bij een soort VVV-kantoortje waar men niet snapte was 6 jongeren nou graag zouden willen zien in de stad. Na het inwinnen van informatie die we al hadden kwamen we langs een Chinees waar ze een lunchbuffet hadden voor 59 Dkr (ruim €7) per persoon. We hadden ons helemaal volgestopt toen ze ook nog extra eten op tafel gingen zetten omdat het buffet afgelopen was; ’Kak…’ Daarna binnengelopen bij een kostelijke kostuumzaak waar ze alle soorten en maten stoffen hadden en Haap en Jieter hebben een koksbuis besteld. We vonden toen een Irish Pub waar we Guinness hebben gehakt en de WiFi misbruikt om mail, Facebook en dergelijke bij te werken. Weer op de boot hebben we knakworst op brood gegeten en wat wijn gedronken en zo weer lekker naar bed. Waarschijnlijk morgen weer naar Nederland varen. Het plan was om nog lang Helgoland te gaan, maar nu gaan we waarschijnlijk direct naar Lauwersoog om nog met de motorboot van Martijn te spelen.",

			"text": "Opgestaan om 9:00 uur; Martijn was al eerder opgestaan voor een strandwandeling en om die malle witte beelden van Esbjerg te bekijken. Na het ontbijt zijn we met de 4 heren naar het oude lichtschip gegaan dat ook in de haven lag en dat te bezichtigen is. Het lichtschip was het laatste Deense lichtschip dat uit gebruik is genomen in 1989. De dames gingen ondertussen afwassen en koffie zetten, wat een taakverdeling! Het plan was om overdag nog in Esbjerg door te brengen en om inkopen te doen en kaartjes en souvenirs te kopen. ’s Avonds zouden we dan vertrekken richting Nederland na het avondeten. ![Poolen in 'Paddy go Easy'](IMG_2089.thumb.JPG) Na wat te hebben rondgewandeld, kaartjes te hebben gekocht en geluncht zijn we weer naar de Irish Pub ‘Paddy Go Easy’ gegaan om daar nog wat koffie te drinken, de WiFi te gebruiken en te poolen. We besloten de groep op te splitsen; Haap en Margriet zouden boodschappen doen en de rest zou in de pub blijven en later komen. Op de terugweg hebben we onze kronen nog  opgemaakt aan ijsjes en zijn nog even een computerzaak in gelopen op zoek naar een zekering voor Henk. Henk was op het laatste stuk naar Thyborøn kapot gegaan en er was dus een zekering nodig voor reparatie. De man in de computerwinkel had ze niet, maar wist een plek waar ze die zeker wel zouden hebben. Hij printte voor ons een adres uit en we gingen op zoek. Na ongeveer drie kwartier lopen waren we er en het was een huis ergens in een buitenwijk. De man bij de computerwinkel had ons het huisadres van de eigenaar gegeven! Het was rond 18:00 uur en de eigenaar kwam toevallig net aanrijden. Die was duidelijk niet gecharmeerd van onze aanwezigheid en kon ons natuurlijk ook niet helpen. We hadden intussen al behoorlijk honger en begonnen aan de lange reis naar de boot. Jantine had slippers aan en die had behoorlijk last van haar voeten toen we aankwamen. Gelukkig was er een flinke pot pastasalade klaar. Na het eten klaargemaakt en vertrokken. Er stond een windkracht 3 Bft uit het zuidwesten en ik had met Jieter de eerste wacht tot 0:00 uur. Mooie zonsondergang gezien en na onze wacht Haap en Martijn op het dek. \n\n![111](IMG_2089.thumb.JPG) Vanochtend om 8:00 uur wakker gemaakt door Jantine om met Jieter aan dek te komen. ![Plaatje vanuit de mast, om wat te doen te hebben en de boel eens te inspecteren](IMG_2106.thumb.JPG) De wind was er helemaal uit en we waren aan het motoren. De wind trok wel even aan vanuit het noordwesten, maar ging na twee, drie uur ook weer liggen. Het is wel lekker weer, dus we kunnen op het dek liggen zonnen en lezen. Jieter is ook nog even de mast in gehesen voor ‘inspectie’ en heeft wat foto’s gemaakt. We hebben nog zo’n 100 mijl te gaan voor we in Harlingen zijn. Lauwersoog ging niet lukken, maar in Harlingen zijn wat bekenden, dus daar gaan we nu heen. Morgen komen we daar rond 12:00 uur aan. \n\nDonderdagochtend ben ik om 8:00 uur weer uit bed geschopt en met moeite wakker geworden. Eenmaal aan dek was te zien dat we boven Terschelling en Vlieland lagen. We waren vannacht door de laatste ‘shipping lanes’ boven Nederland gevaren en zouden tussen Terschelling en Vlieland door steken naar Harlingen. De wind had ondertussen ook nog helemaal niet aan gestaan, maar begon een beetje toen we de Waddenzee op voeren. Omdat we de hele nacht hadden gemotord wilden we diesel bunkeren in de haven van Vlieland. Daar voeren we binnen rond 10:00 uur, maar konden geen tankplaats vinden. Na het oproepen van de haven over de marifoon bleek die er ook niet te zijn en zijn we doorgevaren naar Harlingen. Wat ons opviel was de enorme drukte; je kon bijna over de boten lopen! De afgelopen weken hadden we bijna geen boten gezien en nu deze drukte… De wind trok ondertussen aan tot een NW 3-4 Bft en rond 14:00 uur hebben we de haven opgeroepen of we ergens konden bunkeren. Dat kon helemaal achter in de Industriehaven en dat hebben we gedaan. Hierna zijn we teruggevaren om door de brug te Noorderhaven binnen te lopen. Bij de brug stonden Dirk, Johannes en Lina al op ons te wachten. Zij waren met een kleine platbodem, de Swalk, aan het varen. Toen we vastlagen rond 15:00 uur de laatste blikjes bier open getrokken en zijn gaan douchen. Daarna hebben we nog wat door de stad gelopen en zijn eten gaan koken. Tijdens het eten koken kwamen er twee douaniers langs die vermoedden dat we in het buitenland waren geweest en ons kwamen controleren. De opvarenden van de Swalk aten ook mee en na het eten zijn we nog naar een kroegje gegaan. Die had een ontzettend foute inrichting, maar lekker Nederlands bier en goede bediening. Om 23:11 uur zijn we afgezwaaid en hebben in de boot nog braadworst gegeten en Beerenburg gedronken voor we gingen slapen. We zijn weer in Nederland…",

Het plan was om van Harlingen naar Medemblik te gaan om daar het gehuurde reddingsvlot af te leveren (die zat niet bij de boot) en daarna door te varen naar Stavoren. We zijn van Harlingen door de vaargeul naar de Kornwerder sluizen (Lorentzsluizen) gevaren met alleen de genua. De wind was flink aangetrokken tot NW 5-6 Bft en we besloten na de sluis de genua te wisselen voor de high aspect. Na een lunch met pannenkoeken weer vertrokken richting Medemblik. Net vertrokken wisten we precies over het stukje IJsselmeer te varen waar het ondieper was dan 2 meter en rakte we even kort de bodem. Op ruime wind zonder echt hoge golven waren we binnen ‘no time’ in Medemblik om het vlot af te leveren. We gingen kort aan de steiger voor de brug liggen terwijl ik en Jieter het vlot terug brachten. De brugwachter vond het een minder goed idee dat we daar lagen, dus moesten ik en Jieter aan boord springen terwijl de Equilibre langs voer. Om 17:00 uur uit Medemblik weggevaren en op halve wind naar Stavoren gevaren waar ik de boot letterlijk de box in knalde om 19:00 uur. Dankzij Haap was het eten precies klaar toen we vastlagen en toen we dat opgegeten hadden, hebben we Margriet uitgezwaaid die door haar ouders werd opgehaald. Daarna naar een kroegje gegaan, de laatste braadworsten opgegeten en gaan slapen.",

Een beetje onhandig, zeker omdat ook het analoge kompas een behoorlijke afwijking heeft. Maargoed, we varen geen wedstrijd dus een paar mijl extra varen scheelt enkel nachtrust.\n\nHet plan was eigenlijk te overnachten aan de wachtsteiger van de Schellingwoudebrug, maar de overijverige brugwachter gooit de lampjes al op rood-groen. Op Jieters vraag of we aan de wachtsteiger van de oranjesluizen mogen liggen komt een negatief antwoord. Zulke dingen moet je natuurlijk ook niet vragen, maar gewoon doen.\n\nDan maar op zoek naar een plekje in een marina in Amsterdam. Aeolus' stoplicht geeft aan dat ze vol zitten, maar in de immer gezellige Six-haven is nog wel een boot te persen. Tegenover de woonark leggen we aan. Dat we daardoor de doorgang bijna helemaal blokkeren, is van later zorg: nu eerst nog even genieten van de gezelligheid en een biertje..."

De Batouwe wil niet echt achteruitvaren, zeker niet met weinig snelheid. Met een paar keer steken lukt het om uit het straatje te komen, maar we zijn niet de enige boot: twee anderen willen naar buiten terwijl nog een kruisertje naar binnen komt. Gelukkig gaat alles lekker rustig en kunnen we ook deze rush hour puzzel aan.\n\nEven voordat de pont aankomt meren we af in de voorhaven van het Noord-Hollands kanaal. Vrij snel na de begroeting gaan we weer op weg richting IJmuiden. Het waait best prima uit een goede hoek het zeil kan dus meteen omhoog. Factor 50 mag uit de tas, want het zonnetje begint goed te branden. Niet altijd even rap, maar gestaag worden de mijltjes richting zee afgelegd..."

We moeten een paar slagjes maken, maar tegen de tijd dat er niet meer richting het noorden gekoerst hoeft te worden is het bezeild en gaat het rustig richting Den Oever. We genieten van het uitzicht, de vogels op de droogvallen de platen. \n\nNa een vlotte schutting door de Stevinsluizen gaat het weer zeilend verder richting Enkhuizen. Omdat de koers plat voor het laken is prusten Abraham en Jieter een neerhouder op de spi-boom. Als dat eenmaal goed en wel staat blijkt dat de koers toch wel wat verder van voor de wind af ligt dan we dachten, dus gaat de hele boel weer weg en varen we rustig door. ![](DSCN8715.thumb.JPG) Na het avondeten zitten Cees Jan en Jieter rustig op de giek. Cees Jan vraagt zich af wat er gebeurt als er een gijp zou komen. Even later komt die en hangt Jieter boven de zeerailing terwijl het zeil hem graag van de giek af wil duwen.\n\nWe passeren <em>De Kreupel</em> waar het lekker vol ligt. Gelukkig is er nog wel plaats in Enkhuizen. Naast alle stapeltjes van vijf en zes is er achterin de buitenhaven nog een motorboot waar niemand naast durft te liggen. Op de kant staat Joanne te wachten terwijl we de boot langszij de enge motorboot parkeren. \n\nTijd voor een rosé en muziek, want Joanne heeft de accordeon van Cees Jan meegenomen. ![](DSCN8738.thumb.JPG) De buren kunnen het ook wel waarderen, maar om scheve gezichten te voorkomen houden we er rond elven mee op..."

Een laatste stuurcorrectie baat niet, de ton laat een mooie groene streep achter op de romp.\n\nHet is al vrij rap gedaan met het zeilen, de wind kakt er uit. We zien mooie stroomrafelingen en de stroom geeft ons een flinke zet mee naar buiten.

Alleen de twee Britse boten naast ons, die ook om 10:00 zouden uitvaren, denken daar anders over. We starten de motor, en gaan met z'n allen in de richting van onze buren varen. Nadat Jieter nog maar eens lichtjes heeft aangedrongen of ze nu dan toch echt weggaan, besluiten de buren om krijgsraad te gaan houden. Gaan we nu wel, of juist niet, dicht langs de Portland Bill. Een ware beproeving voor de bemanning van de Equilibre. Uiteindelijk varen we, na een Tanataluskwelling van 12 minuten, alsnog weg van de steiger.\n\nHet blijkt een goede zet te zijn geweest om nog een vislijntje te kopen in de stad. De uitleg van de zeer enthousiaste winkelmedewerker maakt dat wij een goede set hebben om makrelen mee te vangen. De visjes zelf zijn het voor de verandering daarmee eens. ![Markeeltje van de haak halen.](IMG_7474_visvangen.thumb.JPG) We hebben er in no-time twee aan de haak zitten, die door onze eigen Coxswain professioneel ![om zeep worden geholpen](http://youtu.be/4l4QOLoH9Eo). Onze koks-man zet ze vervolgens om in een lekker gebakken visje bij de lunch.\n\nHet weer doet een beetje moeilijk vandaag. De wind varieert tussen de 4 en 11 knopen, en ook het zicht laat het soms weer afweten. In onze eigen wereld vermaken we ons prima, waarbij we ook ons toeterende toneelstuk weer voortzetten. Als we tegen de tijstroom in proberen te zeilen wordt het te gortig. We varen met 2,5 knoop naar achteren, van Poole vandaan. De pruttel wordt weer aangeslingerd, en \"slowly but surely\" worden we naar het noorden geduwd.\n\nOmdat we er eigenlijk allemaal wel flauw van zijn nemen we een kijkje in Swanage, om onze overnachtingsmogelijkheden daar te beschouwen. Er blijken nog genoeg meerboeien vrij te zijn met voldoende diepte, dus we maken ons klaar voor de nacht.\n\nVoor het avondamusement gaan we aan wal, met zijn vijven in onze bijboot. Dat blijkt an sich al een hele excersitie te zijn. We komen veilig aan wal, en maken het dorpje onveilig. We sluiten de avond af met een pint locaal bier in de Ship Inn. Door de regen gaan we terug naar ons bijbootje. De steiger waaraan deze ligt blijkt alleen nog bereikaar over een loopplank die onder water is komen te staan. We maken ons op voor een nacht aan de mooring. Jieter zegt hierover later: \"alleen bij de kentering van het tij was het wat onrustig\". Daar heeft hij gelijk mee. Alleen jammer dat die kentering zo lang heeft geduurd.\n\n43 mijl in 9 uur.",

Hoewel we eerder besloten hadden naar Bembridge te gaan, is ook dat doel van tafel geveegd; iets met te ondiep en onhandig en Bembridge in 1 zin.\n\nHet is mooi weer, de zon schijnt, dus we smeren weer vollop met de sjonniebrand en de sjonniebrillen moeten ook op. De vislijn wordt uitgegooid, maar de haakjes zitten deze keer vol met wier, blijkbaar houden makrelen daar niet van. Rond kwart voor 12 passeren we een groene boei met vaal groen plekje en ![Pannenkoeken. Alweer...](IMG_7574_pannenkoeken.thumb.JPG) worden er weer pannenkoeken gebakken. Die engelsen bakken broden als steen.\n\n![Regenbui met op de achtergrond het eiland Wight](IMG_7589_bui-abraham.thumb.JPG) De wind is soms zoek, soms aan en soms teveel voor de genua, dus we spelen het spelletje mee en doen afwisselende trucjes met de genua in en uit en wisselen 'm met de HA. Precies vlak voor dat de wind er uitkakt, ligt de HA weer op het dek en kan de genua het laatste zuchtje wind ons een zetje meegeven. We hebben het tij tegen en dus motoren we gestaag verder. Terwijl Abraham kookt en Henk roert, maakt Jieter van het huikje een geimproviseerde tent. Zodoende zitten Pauli en Jieter buiten toch lekker droog hun eten op te eten en te tellen hoeveel tijd er tussen de flitsen en rommels zitten; we denken dat het onweer op zo'n 3 kilometer afstand is. Daar blijft gelukkig ook, de windmeter geeft 10 kts aan, en ondanks dat we zeilend langzamer gaan, mag Henk toch naar binnen, want dat is rustiger.\n\nDe kust is goed verlicht; we zien overal lampjes en ook 2 keer vuurwerk - oooooooh! Ook blijkt dat het knipperlichtje die wel een heel bijzondere flash heeft, geen boei is, maar een kermisattractie. Als we op de haven aanlopen en op zoek zijn naar een zuidkardinaal op 12 uur, kunnen we die niet vinden. Deze keer is het niet de mist die zand in het eten gooit, maar een mis(t)plaatst ledlichtje die een steekje mist. Terwijl Haap en Abraham overtuigd raken van waar we heen moeten, twijfelt Pauli steeds meer of er überhaupt wel een haven is en of we dan nog eerst een brug door moeten (als we de haven binnenvaren is ze wel overtuigd en bij vertrek blijken de lampjes in grote bogen de lampjes boven op de krijtrotsen - ipv bruggen - te zijn). Als Haap de havenmeester oproept is de eerste vraag die hij krijgt hoe diep we steken; de haveningang is met laag water te ondiep voor ons, dus krijgen we het advies anderhalf uur voor of na laag water de haven in/uit te gaan.\n\nHet is even voor 11 als we aanmeren en Pauli bij haar ietwat onhandige landing op de vingersteiger het trapje van de buren via hun boot het water inschopt. Het duurt niet lang of we zien het slaperige hoofd van onze Nederlandse buurvrouw mopperend te voorschijn komen: \"What the HECK!\" is haar eerste primaire reactie. Terwijl Jieter de verdere opmerkingen als 'dat kan je van een Nederlandse boot ook wel verwachten' incasseert en haar kalmeert door te zeggen dat ze haar vlag moet binnenhalen, voorziet de rest van de bemanning de boot van TLC en walstroom. Na een borrel en geen douche (de havenmeester heeft voor dat soort dingen na 22.00 geen dienst meer) zoekt iedereen zijn plekje in de kooi weer op. Na 68 mijl in 13 uur en 20 minuten zijn we aan wat slaap aan toe!",

We hebben toch wel erg veel helling, dus er gaat na een klein stukje ook maar een rif in. Als we eenmaal kunnen afvallen richting boei CS2 komt er wat meer rust in de boot. Het gaat lekker hard, we noteren in het logboek veel grondsnelheden van boven de 7kts. Haap schrikt hier zo van dat hij <em>'er gebeurd geen flikker, maar we gaan \"like the firebrigade\"'</em> schrijft. We bakken pannenkoeken, steken de noordgaande shippinglane over en komen in de buurt van Boulogne. Niemand heeft de boekjes echt goed bestudeerd, dus we weten eigenlijk niet precies waar het havengaatje nou zit. Haap weet zeker dat hij golven ziet breken op de kopse kant, maar waar hij een kopse kant ziet staat gewoon een muur.

Een prachtig stukje entertainment volgt waarbij de buurman kunstjes aan het doen is met zijn zeiljacht. Ze zijn ook maar met zijn tweetjes... aan dek. Het blijkt dat er benedendeks nog drie jeugdigen liggen, die blijkbaar wilden uitslapen. Door het wat slordig afvaren staan er bij de vier jachten die benedenwinds liggen ineens mensen aan dek, die er eerst nog niet waren.

Na de sluis maken we de pruttel nog even blij met wat nieuwe diesel.\n\nOp het Haringvliet blijkt een blik open zeilbootjes te zijn opengetrokken: er komen er steeds meer uit de haven.

We eten pastasalade en besluiten maar gewoon te gaan varen om te zien hoe het is en te kijken hoe ver we komen. \nHet Slijkgat ligt in de wind en we besluiten om eruit te motoren.

Omdat we allemaal nog niet lekker zijn uitgerust besluiten we aan het begin van de nacht dat we maar stuurboord uit de Maasmond ingaan. Helaas duurt het dan nog wel behoorlijk lang voor we ergens kunnen aanleggen, zeker met een knoop of 3,5 stroom tegen.\nTegen vieren varen we de voorhaven van Maassluis binnen, niet bepaald een vriendelijke plek voor jachten.

Het is best druk en we melden ons keurig bij Sector Maasmond.Na verloop van tijd roept de sector ons op om te vragen of we meer richting bakboord naar het noorden willen komen. Ik vaar al strak stuurboordswal en vraag wat hij precies bedoelt. Hij blijft er bij dat ik naar het noorden en naar bakboord moet komen.\nAls het weer wat rustiger is krijgen we zelfs een berisping dat we wel naar hem moeten luisteren, of vertellen dat we iets anders beslissen te doen. Als ik reageer met dat ik werkelijk niet begrijp wat hij bedoelt en dat ik gewoon stuurboordswal heb aangehouden is het even stil en biedt hij zijn excuses aan: hij heeft ons met een ander bootje verwisselt, wat inderdaad aan de zuidkant van de geul vreemde dingen deed.\n\nEenmaal in het gebied van Pilot Maas blijkt dat we weer iets lastigs hebben bedacht voor de heren: onze track naar een waypoint net west van de ingang van Maas North TSS gaat nogal dicht langs de pilot boarding area. En daar worden ze een beetje zenuwachtig van. Gelukkig luisteren wij braaf naar wat ze zeggen en kijken we ook nog goed op de AIS. Als we zijn gebied verlaten bedankt de meneer van Pilot Maas ons voor de medewerking en wenst ons een goede reis.\n\n![Vreemd stilliggend schip](heenweg-raar-schip.jpg) Rond een uur of acht zien we een jacht wat niet echt vaart. We verleggen de koers een klein beetje om zo wat dichter bij hem langs te varen. Als hij door heeft dat we op hem afkomen start hij de motor en gaat er vandoor, haaks op onze koers. We zien niemand aan boord, maar wel een fok waar de flarden bij hangen en een giek zonder grootzeil. Hier kan je van alles van denken, maar ik vond het vooral erg vreemd.\n\n![](heenweg-joris1.jpg \"inline\") \n![](heenweg-joris2.jpg \"inline\")\n\n![Koken op zee: Aardappels, groente, vlees.](heenweg-koken.jpg) \n![Brood bakken](heenweg-broodbakken.jpg)\n![Soms is het gewoon prachtig leeg...](heenweg-zee.jpg) De verdere tocht is een soort opwekkingslied: 'sturen, eten, slapen' 16x. Maar wel echt tot rust komen, genieten van dolfijnen om de boot, ![lege horizons](http://youtu.be/w-9uVUQMVZg) met prachtige wolken er boven, windstiltes. Tot we op de ochtend van 14 juli weer land zien: Eerst Fair Isle, later ook Sumburg Head. Steeds meer details verschijnen Horse I, een hobbeltjes worden bergen.\n\nOm even voor zeven lijkt de wind wat aan te trekken, maar tegen de tijd dat de Genua op dek ligt is de wind weer een tijdje onder de 10kts. Dan maar weer omhoog ermee. \n\nWe varen binnendoor tussen Mainlaind en Mousa door, genieten van het uitzicht op Mousa Broch, de vissende vogels en de prachtige verschillende kleuren op de heuvels van Shetland. Cool om er nu echt te zijn!\n\n![Begraafplaats van Lerwick. Hier lig je wel goed, met zeezicht.](heenweg-aanloop-lerwick.jpg) Dat het een beetje begint de regenen mag de pret niet drukken en we varen rond 11:11 LT Bressay sound binnen, langs de begraafplats, het hoekje om. De havenmeester vertelt ons vriendelijk dat we om de boeg van een grote blauwe boot heen moeten en daar een plekje mogen zoeken. We zijn er! in 100 uur, 570 NM op het log.\n\n![Fish & Chips](fish-chips.jpg)Paul vindt het hoog tijd voor Fish en Chips, dus we lopen via het havenkantoor naar de stad. Na advies van de aardige havenmevrouw zitten we binnen de kortste keren in de vensterbank van 'Fort Cafe & Take away' aan een enorme bak friet met een groot stuk vis er bovenop.",

We proberen eerst de ankerplek East Ham, maar daar wil het anker niet lekker pakken, is het vrij krap en er komt ook nog aardige swell binnen. Als we het anker weer willen optrekken wordt duidelijk dat de ankerlier niet werkt: het anker moet dus maar met de hand omhoog worden getrokken...\n\n![Lol aan boord](fairisle-heenweg.jpg \"inline\")\n![Zeewier opgeankerd uit east ham](fairisle-heenweg-wier.jpg \"inline\")\n\n\nWe varen om de noordpunt heen en proberen West Ham. Daar is het veel rustiger en het anker grijpt er ook meteen echt goed. We tuigen de bijboot op en ik vaar in twee keer iedereen naar de kant. Daar wandelen we door de verlatenheid in het gezelschap van heel wat schaapjes naar de Broch. Dit bouwwerk, wat ruim 2000 jaar oud is bestaat alleen uit gestapelde stenen. Aan de voet is de doorsnede ongeveer 15m en de muren zijn zo breed dat er een soort wenteltrap in zit waarmee je omhoog kunt lopen. Bizar om zo'n oud gebouw in zo'n staat te zien en te beklimmen.\n\n![Mousa Broch](mousa-broch.jpg \"inline\")\n![Mousa Broch](mousa-broch2.jpg \"inline\")\n\n\n![Jieter marcheert terug om een oogje in het zeil te houden.](mousa-terugmarcheren.jpg) Omdat ik nog niet zo vaak heb geankerd wordt ik als de wind wat aantrekt wat zenuwachtig. Eigenlijk niet relaxed om geen zicht op de boot te hebben. Omdat de rest nog niet klaar is met het aanschouwen van de Broch, marcheer ik alvast terug.\n\nDe toeristenferry blokkeert inmiddels de uitgang voor ons bijbootje, maar gelukkig ligt Equilibre nog vredig achter haar anker. De bemanning van de ferry zit in een stenen gebouwtje bij de 'haven' te lunchen: aardappels met gerookte vis. Tijdens het kletsen duurt het niet lang of ik krijg ook een stuk vis aangeboden.\n\n\n![](fairisle-heenweg-cupcakes.jpg) Na dit uitstapje is het tijd voor de volgende 30NM naar Fair Isle. Het is inmiddels ruim tijd voor thee, en Marleen heeft vanmorgen in Lerwick nog cupcakes gekocht. Omdat niemand kan of wil kiezen houden we een soort cupcake-proeverij. hmm.\n\n![](fairisle-heenweg-pauli.jpg \"inline\") ![](fairisle-aanloop.jpg \"inline\")\n\nFair Isle komt steeds beter in zicht. De invaaraanwijzing is simpel: houdt de grote rots voor de haven in lijn met de linkerkant van Sheep Rock, een zeer karakteristieke klif aan de zuidwestkant van het eiland.\n\nEenmaal in de haven is het superbeschut. Omdat we naast een ander jacht aan de Good Shepherd IV liggen breng ik met het bijbootje een landvat naar de kant. Vrijwel direct komen de zeehonden een kijkje nemen. Ze komen hier echt dichtbij, en snuiven wat. Hier snapte ik voor het eerst waarom zeehonden zeehonden heten: ze kijken naar je alsof je zometeen een tennisbal gaat weggooien... Voor als je er nog eens komt: die ene met dat witte vlekje op zijn neus heet Takkie.\n\n![](fairisle-aanloop2.jpg \"inline\") ![](fairisle-borrel.jpg \"inline\")\n\n",

Onze 'buren' van de *Jager* hadden dat beter bekeken en zijn een beetje later vertrokken: stroom mee, en een bezeilde koers dicht bij de kust zorgen er voor dat zij er eerder zijn dan wij.\n\n![Big orange vessel, aldus iemand anders over de marifoon](peterhead-vertrek.jpg) Bij het verlaten van de haven moeten we even wachten omdat er een 'big orange vessel' bezig is met manouvreren in de havenkom.
